👋 Hi, I’m Sevde. After completing my education in Civil Engineering and gaining around 4 years of experience, my passion for software development led me to transition into this field and pursue a professional journey.

👀 I always aim to write functional, practical, and sustainable code, while also focusing on sleek designs. With this approach, I strive to make the software development process both efficient and user-centered.

🌱 Drawing from both my engineering background and the experience I've gained in software development, I aim to create more effective solutions while continuously learning. I am determined to keep improving, dive deeper into new technologies, and bring a fresh perspective to every project.

💞️ Currently, I am focusing on Frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, and React, with the goal of further developing my skills in this area. Additionally, my interest in mobile app development and user-centered design continues to grow.

📫 In team projects, I aim to make a strong contribution with both my technical skills and communication abilities. I believe in delivering high-quality results and adding value to projects while staying true to ethical standards.
